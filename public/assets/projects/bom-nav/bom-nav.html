    In 2023, a project request prompted the extraction of bill of material (BOM) data from Excel. 
    Recognizing the recursive nature of the task, a Python script was initially created to complete the job efficiently. 
    The project evoked my deeper interest in developing a user-friendly web interface using HTML, JavaScript, and Flask.

    The web tool includes routines to nightly import SQL data from the ERP system, enabling users to navigate BOMs across various levels by clicking item numbers. 
    Additionally, an SQL database compiling historical sales data was integrated into the BOM manager. 
    To address faulty item number inputs, a small API service was added.

    This tool is now used daily by engineering co-workers.

    Through this project, extensive learning about Flask, clean coding practices, Python classes, and thorough documentation using docstrings and markdown was achieved. 
    The project is managed through Git, enhancing skills in daily Git workflow.
