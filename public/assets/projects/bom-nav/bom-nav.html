    In 2023, I tackled the challenge of statically extracting Bill of Materials (BOM) data from Excel files. Recognizing the repetitive nature of the task, I opted to build a Python script, completing it within a few days.

    However, this ignited a passion to explore Python's full potential. I constructed a user-friendly web interface using HTML, JavaScript, and Flask. This interface allowed users to browse BOM structures by simply clicking item numbers. Additionally, nightly routines automatically retrieved data from the ERP system, keeping everything up-to-date.

    To further enhance functionality, I integrated an additional SQL database containing historical sales data, providing a more comprehensive view. Addressing the occasional faulty item number entry, I implemented a dedicated API service to rectify errors.

    This project became an invaluable business tool for myself and my engineering colleagues, streamlining daily workflows.

    The tool also served as a valuable learning experience, deepening my understanding of Flask, clean coding principles, Python classes, and effective code documentation practices (including docstrings and markdown). Furthermore, the project's utilization of Git provided valuable insights into efficient Git version control workflows.
