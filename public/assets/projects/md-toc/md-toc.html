    In March 2024, I created a command line script in Python to automatically generate a table of contents from existing headings in markdown files. 
    Additionally, the script includes external links, making it a practical tool for use in my own <a href="/portfolio-react/id/7">Coding Cookbook</a>. 
    This side project emerged from my growing appreciation for the importance of code documentation and the elegance of well-written markdown files.

<!-- Readme extract -->
<div class="image-container">
    <p class="title">Readme extract</p>
    <img class="image" src="/portfolio-react/assets/img/md-toc-thumbnail.png" alt="Readme extract">
    <p class="source">Ralf Tischer on GitHub</p>
</div>

    The tool provided a valuable exercise in Python for text parsing and file handling. I extensively used AI to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of this approach. 
    This project significantly improved my documentation workflow and reinforced my Python programming skills.
