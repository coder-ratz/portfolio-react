    I started my career in railway engineering as a project engineer. 
    My job involved preparing technical offers for mechanical brake systems based on customer specifications and requirements, including physical layout calculations and simulations.

    During the project phase, I led product development, acting as the communicator between the customer and the engineering back office. 
    My responsibilities included all aspects of technical project management, such as manufacturing, product validation, vehicle commissioning, and handling customer claims.

    As a project engineer, I learned all facets of project management and enjoyed close interaction with customers and colleagues from various international sites. 
    My projects include the Sydney Millennium 4GT trains and the VIRM fleet in the Netherlands.
