    In early 2021, I spearheaded a self-organized working group tasked with developing a company intranet using Microsoft SharePoint. We began by collaboratively defining user needs through user stories. We then explored the potential of SharePoint and Office 365 to create a user-friendly and informative platform.

    The project progressed swiftly, and by mid-2021, we launched the intranet site to over 200 colleagues. To ensure user adoption, I conducted a live demonstration showcasing its functionalities. The site rapidly gained traction, attracting content contributions from various departments. Regular user feedback, including an impressive near-5/5 rating in a user poll, confirmed its positive impact on internal communication and collaboration.

    My role extended beyond the initial development phase. As of early 2024, I continue to maintain the site as an administrator, ensuring its ongoing relevance with fresh content.
