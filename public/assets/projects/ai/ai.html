    In late 2022, like many others, I became intrigued by artificial intelligence (AI) as tools like ChatGPT became widely accessible. 
    Utilizing large language models (LLMs) quickly became part of my daily workflow, assisting me with tasks such as writing emails, understanding reports, and creating code.

    My interest extends beyond using AI models; I aim to understand and create them myself. In 2023, I completed a Python Machine Learning course, followed by an in-house AI course in 2024. 
    Additionally, I initiated several AI projects within my engineering domain to support office tasks.

    The continuous emergence of new AI opportunities fascinates me, and I already observe how prompt engineering and other tools are enhancing efficiency. 
    I look forward to further developments and am eager to utilize new tools to solve problems.
