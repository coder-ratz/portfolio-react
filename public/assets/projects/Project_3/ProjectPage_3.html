    In late 2022, I embarked on a project to explore the potential of web technologies for mobile-like experiences. With board gamers in mind, I developed "Draw Start Player," a web tool that simplifies the process of choosing a starting player.

    This interactive tool utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to mimic a smartphone app. Players simply tap the screen with their fingertips, and the application initiates a countdown before randomly selecting a winner through engaging visual effects.

    This project served as a valuable learning experience. I delved into the fascinating world of touch detection within web development and explored the creation of captivating visual effects using HTML graphics. Furthermore, I gained practical experience with setting up and utilizing a GitHub repository for version control.
