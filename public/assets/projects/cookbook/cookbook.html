    This continuous project began as a personal notebook. As I delved deeper into coding, I decided to store my learnings systematically. Initially, the notebook was a single document on my Google Cloud. 
    Over time, it evolved into multiple markdown files and eventually into a GitHub repository with a detailed shortcut structure.

<!-- Table of Contents -->

    <p class="title">Extract of Table of Contents</p>

    <p class="source">Ralf Tischer on GitHub</p>
</div>

    Parallel to the natural development of the cookbook, I started to work on a tool called "<a href="/portfolio-react/id/11">md-toc</a>" to automatically create the table of contents with the desired links.

    The repository now serves as a comprehensive coding cookbook, allowing easy access and organization of coding techniques, best practices, and shortcuts. 
    This project has been instrumental in documenting my progress and has become a valuable resource for my ongoing development work.
