    At the beginning of 2021, as a leading member of a working group, I developed a local intranet site using Microsoft SharePoint. 
    We began by writing user stories, developing a basic structure, and designing while exploring the capabilities of SharePoint and Office 365.

    The project progressed swiftly, and already by mid-2021, we launched the intranet site. 
    To ensure user adoption, I conducted a live demonstration for over 200 colleagues showcasing its functionalities. 
    The intranet site received growing interest from various contributors and was rated nearly 5/5 in a user poll.

    I enjoyed the collaboration during the development phase and the direct user feedback. 
    As of early 2024, I continue to maintain the site as an admin, regularly adding new content and features.
