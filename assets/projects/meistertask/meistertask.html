    In 2022, I automated the task creation process for MeisterTask, a kanban tool used by my team to plan and document tasks. 
    To manage absence times, I wrote a Python script that reads an Excel file containing each team member's absence periods and creates corresponding tasks in MeisterTask using their API.

    Later, I expanded the script to import tasks and additional information from MeisterTask. 
    Through this project, I learned how to use Python classes, interact with APIs, and implement a Git workflow in daily work.
