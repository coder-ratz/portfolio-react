    For more than twenty years, I served as a team lead in an engineering organization, managing a development team of up to twelve members. 
    My team included product managers, design engineers, calculation engineers, RAMS engineers, technical editors, technical clerks, and student workers. 
    Our primary responsibility was the optimization, development, and validation of complex mechanical components for railway vehicle projects.

    My team developed mechanical brake systems for significant railway projects, such as the German high-speed train ICE-4, Metro Sydney, and French commuter trains Regiolis.

    We produced technical specifications, 3D models, technical drawings, and documents to ensure the safety and suitability of our products. 
    To achieve these goals, I continually adjusted team skills and processes, transitioning from a sequential process flow to a customer-centric, agile approach.

    I took great satisfaction in optimizing processes, developing team skills, and introducing and refining new tools as needed.
