    In 2023, I was tasked with statically extracting bill of material (BOM) data from an Excel file. 
    Given the recursive nature of the task, I wrote a small Python script to complete the job in a few days. 
    This project raised my interest in further leveraging Python, leading me to develop a user-friendly web interface using HTML, JavaScript, and Flask.

    I implemented routines to nightly read SQL data from the ERP system, enabling users to browse through BOMs at different levels by simply clicking on an item number. 
    Additionally, I created an SQL database to compile old sales data, integrating this into the BOM manager. 
    To address the issue of faulty item number inputs, I added a small API service.

    This tool is now used daily by my engineering colleagues.

    Through this project, I gained extensive knowledge in Flask, clean coding practices, Python classes, and proper code documentation using docstrings and markdown. 
    The project is fully managed with Git, providing valuable experience in the daily Git workflow.
