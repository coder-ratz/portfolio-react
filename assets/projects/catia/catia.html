    Due to an update in the data structure, I had to perform a major update on an existing Catia VBA script that I had been loosely managing. 
    The script's purpose was to automatically create and populate the file block of 2D drawings. 
    I decided to completely refactor it by applying an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.

    <img class="image" src="/portfolio-react/assets/img/catia-thumbnail.png" alt="Schematic view of data flow">
    <p class="source">Faiveley Transport Bochum GmbH</p>
</div>

    During this process, I identified several inefficiencies in the code and significantly increased the script's performance. 
    Additionally, I introduced new functions to meet the updated requirements.

<!-- Result in Catia -->

    Despite the challenge of returning to an older language like VBA, I appreciated the opportunity to enhance my basic coding knowledge. 
    This project taught me that modern software design principles can be applied universally, even when not directly supported by the tools at hand.
