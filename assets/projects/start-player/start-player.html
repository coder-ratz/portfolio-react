    In late 2022, I developed a tool for smartphones and tablets using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

    Designed for board gamers, the tool collects the fingertips of multiple players, starts a countdown, and randomly selects a winner.

    This project allowed me to explore how a website can function like a smartphone app, incorporating touch detection and HTML graphic effects. 
    I also learned how to set up and use a GitHub repository, gaining valuable experience in version control.
