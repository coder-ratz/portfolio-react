    I not only led the product management team but also served as a product manager for a specific domain. 
    In regular meetings, I presented the development of my domain over the past three months to the management team. 
    My role included design and cost improvements, subcontracting to countries with better cost structure, and product standardization.

    This experience broadened my perspective on products, particularly regarding commercial aspects.
