    Between 2013 and 2014, I completed a series of three courses to become a VDI certified value analyst.

    Subsequently, I applied my learnings by managing several internal value analysis projects, leading to significant product developments focused on cost reductions.

    The approach of value engineering expands my personal toolbox with techniques such as function analysis, Quality Function Deployment (QFD), and moderation skills. 
    These methods continue to assist me in daily problem-solving and project management.
